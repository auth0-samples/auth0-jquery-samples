# Rules

This example shows how to add and work with `Auth0` rules, which are very useful to extend functionality.

You can read a quickstart guide for this sample [here](https://auth0.com/docs/quickstart/spa/jquery/06-rules).

## Before running the example

Rename `auth0-variables.js.example` to `auth0-variables.js` and make sure that you have both the `Client ID` and `Client Secret`in it. You can find that information in the settings section of your Auth0 Client. Also, make sure to add the callback URL (`http://localhost:3000/` if you are testing locally) in the **Allowed Callback URLs** section, as explained [here](https://auth0.com/docs/quickstart/spa/jquery/01-login#before-starting)

## Running the example

In order to run the example you need to just start a server. What we suggest is doing the following:

1. Install node
2. run `npm install -g serve`
3. run `serve -p 3000` in the directory of the project.

Go to `http://localhost:3000` and you'll see the app running.

## What is Auth0?

Auth0 helps you to:

* Add authentication with [multiple authentication sources](https://docs.auth0.com/identityproviders), either social like **Google, Facebook, Microsoft Account, LinkedIn, GitHub, Twitter, Box, Salesforce, among others**, or enterprise identity systems like **Windows Azure AD, Google Apps, Active Directory, ADFS or any SAML Identity Provider**.
* Add authentication through more traditional **[username/password databases](https://docs.auth0.com/mysql-connection-tutorial)**.
* Add support for **[linking different user accounts](https://docs.auth0.com/link-accounts)** with the same user.
* Support for generating signed [JSON Web Tokens](https://docs.auth0.com/jwt) to call your APIs and **flow the user identity** securely.
* Analytics of how, when and where users are logging in.
* Pull data from other sources and add it to the user profile, through [JavaScript rules](https://docs.auth0.com/rules).

## Create a free account in Auth0
